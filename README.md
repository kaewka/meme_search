meme_search
===========
Meme search allows user to search for meme images based on keywords and post the image on Facebook, twitter feeds or send it through email or other app that support intents.

For meme image search, we plan to use the search API from imgur.com.  We could also make it a meme generator by allowing user to add some text in the image.
